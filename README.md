## Description

This application was built to serve as a source for me or others to turn to in order to find basic information learned in the prework section of GA Tech's coding bootcamp. Hopefully it will be a usefull place to turn to for recalling the early lessons before class officially started. So far I've learned the basics of web development, installed some software that is essentialy for writing and managing code, and leanred the basics of git and github.
